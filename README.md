# Mpyrifera-model
This repo contains code needed to run a SWAN wave model for the Wellington, NZ. It also contains a numerical biomechanical model formulation (R) for examining the forces acting on a Macrocystis plant. This code accompanies the publication: Jones et al. (2015) Modelling the effect of wave forces on subtidal macroalgae
